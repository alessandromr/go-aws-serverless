# Go AWS Serverless

This is a Work in Progress golang package to speed up resources deployment in serverless workflows. 
This package is mainly written to support `aws-serverless` terraform provider.

## How it works
To speed up serverless deployment this package wrap up official AWS sdk methods and resources to provide the developer an higher level of abstraction.


## How to use it
This is a simple sdk wrapper so you can just include it:

```go
import "github.com/alessandromr/go-aws-serverless"
```
